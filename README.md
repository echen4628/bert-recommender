IMPORTANT FILES!
* requirements.txt specifies the needed packages
* scrape_nips.py is used to scrape the nips webpage. (It is not neccessary to run this because I provide the uncleaned and cleaned csv files)
* generate_embeddings.py is used to generate the abstract embeddings
* KMeans_Experiment copy.ipynb is an example file I used in the code review video.
* KMeans_Experiment.ipynb, GMM_Experiment.ipynb, and DBSCAN_Experiment.ipynb are what I used for the paper. Note that the results can be a bit stochastic, particularly because umap is a stochastic algorithm.
